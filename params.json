{"name":"PEcAn","tagline":"The Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer","body":"#  Background: \r\nClimate change science has witnessed an explosion in the amount and types of data that can be brought to bear on the potential responses of the terrestrial carbon cycle and biodiversity to global change. Many of the most pressing questions about global change are not necessarily limited by the need to collect new data as much as by our ability to synthesize existing data. This project specifically seeks to improve this ability. Because no one measurement provides a complete picture, multiple data sources must be integrated in a sensible manner. Process-based models represent an ideal framework for integrating these data streams because they represent multiple processes at different spatial and temporal scales in ways that capture our current understanding of the causal connections across scales and among data types. Three components are required to bridge this gap between the available data and the required level of understanding: 1) a state-of-the-art ecosystem model, 2) a workflow management system to handle the numerous streams of data, and 3) a data assimilation statistical framework in order to synthesize the data with the model.\r\n\r\n# PEcAn's Approach: \r\nTo meet these needs, we are developing two bioinformatics tools: 1) a scientific workflow and 2) a Bayesian data assimilation system. These tools were initially developed around the Ecosystem Demography model (ED), one of the few models capable of integrating a large suite of observational data at different spatial and temporal scales. The workflow can be used with other models; current work is focused on integrating BioCro, DayCent, Ibis, and SIPNET. The output of the data assimilation system will be a regional-scale high-resolution estimate of both the terrestrial carbon cycle and plant biodiversity based on the best available data and with a robust accounting of the uncertainties involved. The workflow system will allow ecosystem modeling to be more transparent, reproducible, and automated, and thus ultimately more defensible to both peers and the public. It will also reduce the redundancy of effort among modeling groups, facilitate collaboration, and make models more accessible the rest of the research community. \r\n\r\n**Acknowledgements:** The PEcAn project is supported by the National Science Foundation (ABI #1062547, ARC #1023477), the Department of Energy (ARPA-E awards #DE-AR0000594 and DE-AR0000598), and the Energy Biosciences Institute.\r\n\r\nPEcAn is open-source and built using open source software, and we benefit from the use of a wide range of other software, including R, JAGS, MySQL, Ruby on Rails, PHP, C, and Fortran.
