As Google Summer of Code 2024 comes to a close, the PEcAn project is proud to highlight the outstanding work of this year's participants.
Participating in GSOC over the past eight years has been an opportunity not to expand our code base as well as our community.

This year we had four exciting new projects:

1. Pratik Prakhale's project "Adopting Data Schema for Field Management Events" defined a JSON schema and integrated it into the FieldActivity R Shiny App. This allows for more flexible and standardized data storage of field management events, and makes it easier to expand the FieldActivity App as well as build other robust applications that depend on the Schema

2. Abhinav Pandey "Optimize PEcAn for freestanding use of single packages" helped to make PEcAn projects more standalone and thus easier for use by the broader community. Many PEcAn R packages depend on each other and to a Postgres database. Abhinav's work refactored code to reduced these dependencies.  https://dev.to/devrx/my-gsoc-experience-pecan-project-bi0

3. Sambhav Dixit: "Machine Learning Downscaling of PEcAn Outputs" used Convolutional Neural Networks to enable downscaling of ecosystem model output to high spatial resolution while retaining information contained in ensemble based uncertainty estimates.

4. Meet Agrawal worked on "PEcAn Code Hardening by Integration Tests", a project that enhanced the reliability of PEcAn's codebase by improving integration tests.

These projects helped advance PEcAn's code, provided valuable experiences to both mentees and mentors. We are grateful to  the participants, mentors, and everyone in the PEcAn community who continue to make the project and our GSOC experiences a success.
